It would be convenient to take the lowest and highest value in the field that we are examining, in fact that is how IBM demonstrates those examples, but that violates the rule that the user does not have any info of the dataset before the DP processing.\n",
    " - __Non-DP preprocessing__. If we ask complicated queries (ex Surgeries performed in Stanford), the library does not offer a way to preprocess the data, thus we trust python in doing so, which results in a non-DP way of shrinking the dataset. The result that is given is of course differential private, but what happens if the dataset has only 1 record in it? That, while being a very extreme case, violates the definition of differential privacy."
